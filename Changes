Revision history for Win32-Process-Info


  - Fix for 64 bit Perls on Windows (rt101658)

1.021		2014-12-02	T. R. Wyant
  No changes since 1.020_01

1.020_01	2014-11-19	T. R. Wyant
  Some tweaks to author testing, and move code from Subversion to Git.
    None of this should affect the user, but ...

1.020		2013-02-24	T. R. Wyant
  No changes since 1.019_04.

1.019_04	2013-02-17	T. R. Wyant
  Fix problem with testing 'PT' variant in t/basic.t under Cygwin.

1.019_03	2013-02-14	T. R. Wyant
  Introduce the My_Pid() method. The base method returns $$ except under
    Cygwin, where it returns Cygwin::pid_to_winpid($$). But under the PT
    variant it always returns $$.
  Retract the $MY_PID variable, since it was inadequate to handle the
    behavior of the PT variant under Cygwin.

1.019_02	2013-02-09	T. R. Wyant
  Try to fix occasional fatal error in NT variant where the SID is valid
    but the attemot to fetch the authority fails.

1.019_01	2013-02-06	T. R. Wyant
  Create new global variable $MY_PID, which is Cygwin::pid_to_winpid($$)
    under Cygwin, and just $$ under everything else. Rewrite all uses of
    $$ to $MY_PID. $MY_PID is documented as experimental, and (under
    Cygwin) does not have the forking magic of $$. Thanks to Mithun
    Ayachit for letting me know about the $$ problem under Cygwin and
    providing the solution.
  Bring Changes file into compliance with Test::CPAN::Changes. Add
    author test xt/author/changes.t to be sure it stays that way.

1.019		2011-12-28	T. R. Wyant
  No changes from 1.018_90 other than version.

1.018_90	2011-12-03	T. R. Wyant
  Correct test for ReactOS -- it appears $ENV{OS} can not be relied on
    to be defined in all Windows systems. Thanks to Marc Bilodeau for
    finding this in his Apache logs.
  Redo most tests in terms of Test::More 0.88, and require this for
    build.
  Get serious about dependencies, including core modules.
  Update copy of GNU GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF
    address.
  Revise copyright statement in README.

1.018		2011-05-01	T. R. Wyant
  Fix uninitialized value warnings in Win32::Process::Info::PT under
    Perl 5.14.0-RC1.

1.017		2011-02-16	T. R. Wyant
  No changes other than version from 1.016_02.

1.016_02	2011-02-10	T. R. Wyant
  Correct fatal typo in Makefile.PL.
  Move author tests from xt/ to xt/author/.

1.016_01	2011-02-03	T. R. Wyant
  Add Win32::Process::Info->variant_support_status( $variant ), which
    returns false if the variant is supported, and a message if not.
    Re-implement in terms of this.
  Make support check for WMI variant like that in t/basic.t, which is
    more comprehensive.
  Correct check for ReactOS.
  Merge subprocess check into t/basic.t.
  Correct SYNOPSIS code to handle an undefined process name. Thanks to
    'fleg' for reporting this on annocpan.
  Document the need for an explicit import() after loading via 'require'
    rather than 'use'.
  When checking for support of the NT variant, use File::Spec->path() to
    dissect the path, rather than doing it by hand, since my code did
    not work under Cygwin, and File::Spec was already required.

1.016		2010-04-18	T. R. Wyant
  Retract test t/sub.t while I rethink how tests work.

1.015		2010-04-15	T. R. Wyant
  Use eval { $invocant->isa( ... ) } instead of isa( $invocant, ... ),
    since the latter is deprecated under Perl 5.12.
  Document the need for an explicit import() in the NOTICE section of
    the Win32::Process::Info POD. Provide an explicit error message to
    this effect in new() if import() has in fact not been called.
    Thanks to Piotr Lewandowski for reporting this omission.
  Move change history to the Changes file.
  Convert to the CPAN-recommended license.
  Author-only tests are now run by the authortest Module::Build target.
    They are unavailable under ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
  Various tweaks for ReactOS. The NT variant appears to work under
    0.3.11, except that it can not retrieve the process owner.
  Do not require Module::Build for configuration, since MakeMaker is
    also supported.

1.014		2009-04-06	T. R. Wyant
  Missed change when replacing @_ with @args. Thanks to Erik Weidel for
    spotting this. Why the test suite worked for me I haven't a clue.

1.013		2009-04-02	T. R. Wyant
  Disable WMI under ReactOS (otherwise it dies horribly).
  Have Subprocesses() skip processes with undefined creation dates.
    Thanks to erikweidel for the bug report and the patch.
  Make Perl::Critic compliant, with the perlcriticrc in the t directory.
    Except for NT.pm and WMI.pm.

1.012		2008-06-12	T. R. Wyant
  Check for re-used parent process IDs in Subprocesses(), and eliminate
    subprocesses created before their parents.
  Add SubProcInfo(), which calls GetProcInfo() and then adds key
    {subProcesses} based on {ParentProcessId}.

1.011		2007-12-28	T. R. Wyant
  use warnings in all modules. This requires Perl 5.6.
  Remove shebang lines in tests.
  Explicit 'use 5.006' in Makefile.PL and Build.PL, since 'use
    warnings;' requires that.
  Simplify t/pod.t.
  Simplify t/pod_coverage.t, and mark all-uppercase methods private.
  Allow for ExtUtils::MakeMaker development version number in
    Makefile.PL version check.
  Skip process username test in t/basic.t if the username cannot be
    determined.

1.010		2007-08-22	T. R. Wyant
  Replace 'elapsed_as_seconds' with 'elapsed_in_seconds' in synopsis
    code. Also add 'grep' example. Thanks to David Wagner and Derek
    Smith respectively for pointing out the need for these.
  Add and document variant 'PT'.

1.009		2007-03-16	T. R. Wyant
  Fix synopsis code so that it compiles as-is.
  Correct the error message generated when new() is passed a reference
    other than a hash reference.

1.008		2007-01-17	T. R. Wyant
  Clean up the documentation. The new import() documentation, in
    particular, contained a couple abortive attempts to get it right.
    But the real incentive is that the Windows build on ActiveState
    failed because the Makefile was older than Makefile.PL (?!?), so I
    thought I would try sending it through again.

1.007		2007-01-10	T. R. Wyant
  Use the import() hook to determine which variants may be used in the
    script. The previous method was just to feel around the system, and
    this caused problem if fork() was being used. Thanks to Malcolm
    Nooning for finding the problem, helping me work out the solution,
    and sharing the results of his correspondence with ActiveState.

1.006		2005-09-23	T. R. Wyant
  Silently skip non-existent processes in the Subprocesses method. Fix
    provided by Kirk Baucom of Itron, and accepted with thanks.

1.005		2005-03-15	T. R. Wyant
  Moved assertion of seDebugPriv in the NT variant to stop token handle
    leak.
  Turned off $^W for timelocal call, since it throws random warnings
    otherwise.

1.004		2004-12-30	T. R. Wyant
  Remove commented-out dependencies in Makefile.PL, since CPAN's now
    checking. The only one that really counts is Win32, but
    ActiveState's PPM3 chokes on this, or at least did as of January
    2001.

1.003		2004-12-19	T. R. Wyant
  Documented PERL_WIN32_PROCESS_INFO_WMI_DEBUG correctly (the docs had a
    _PRIV on the end).
  Recorded the variant name in the object.
  Clarified (hopefully) the docs on how to use the
    PERL_WIN32_PROCESS_INFO_VARIANT environment variable.
  Added the current status and whereabouts of Win32::IProc. Thanks to
    Eric Bluestein (http://www.emblue.com/) for pointing this out.

1.002		2004-06-07	T. R. Wyant
  Document leaky behavior of WMI variant, and try to make it leak less.
  Document related modules.

1.001		2004-01-05	T. R. Wyant
  Removed dependency on Win32. We still need it, of course, but PPM3
    chokes on it, and I figure anyone who IS using PPM3 already has it,
    and anyone who ISN'T is smart enough to figure out what's going on -
    or at least read the README.

1.000		2003-10-09	T. R. Wyant
  Add assert_debug_priv hash argument to the 'new' method.
  Fix documentation, both pod errors and actual doc bugs.
  When the only thing you've done in two months is add a semicolon to a
    comment, it's probably time to call it production code.

0.014		2003-06-27	T. R. Wyant
  Track changes in Win32::API. Can no longer "require" it.
  WMI variant no longer asserts debug privilege by default.
  Use environment variable PERL_WIN32_PROCESS_INFO_WMI_DEBUG to tell the
    WMI variant whether to assert debug.
  Use environment variable PERL_WIN32_PROCESS_INFO_WMI_PARIAH to encode
    processes to skip when determining the owner.
  Add optional first hash ref argument to GetProcInfo.
  Add Subprocesses() method.

0.013		2003-03-13	T. R. Wyant
  Use environment variable PERL_WIN32_PROCESS_INFO_VARIANT to specify
    the default variant list.
  Add a hash reference argument to new (); use this to specify username
    and password to the WMI variant.
  Turn on debug privilege in NT variant. This also resulted in
    dependency on Win32API::Registry.
  Return OwnerSid and Owner in NT variant.
  Remove dependencies on Win32::API, Win32::OLE, and Win32API::Registry
    from Makefile.PL, since these are conditional.

0.012		2002-11-06	T. R. Wyant
  Made attributes beginning with "_" hidden.
  Add attribute _mutator, containing a reference to %mutator.

0.011		2002-09-14	T. R. Wyant
  Added method Version().
  Fixed warning in NT.pm when -w in effect. Fix provided by Judy Hawkins
    (of Pitney Bowes, according to her mailing address), and accepted
    with thanks.

0.010		2002-09-02	T. R. Wyant
  Released to CPAN.
